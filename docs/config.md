# flowstate Configuration

flowstate reads an optional TOML config file before scanning repositories.

## Config Path

flowstate looks for config in this order:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flowstate/config.toml`
2. `~/.config/flowstate/config.toml`

The file is optional. If it does not exist, flowstate starts with built-in defaults.
If a config file exists but cannot be read or parsed, startup fails before
repository scanning. flowstate only falls through to the next path when the earlier
path does not exist.

## Precedence

Environment variables remain the highest-precedence settings where they already
exist:

| Setting | Highest precedence | Config fallback | Built-in default |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Scan root | `WORKTREE_ROOT` | `[scan].root` | `~/dev` |
| Plan editor command | `[editor].command` | `EDITOR` | unset |
| Terminal command | `TERMINAL` | `[terminal].command` | platform fallback |
| Coding agent | none | `[agent].command` | unset |
| Agent reasoning effort | none | `[agent].codex_reasoning_effort` / `[agent].claude_reasoning_effort` | provider default |
| Startup default view | none | `[ui].default_view` | flows view (`8`) |
| Plan launch prompt | none | `[agent].plan_prompt` | built-in plan implementation prompt |
| Flow phase launch prompts | none | `[flow_prompts]` | built-in Flow phase prompts |
| TUI artifact root | `FLOWSTATE_FLOW_STATE_ROOT` > `FLOWSTATE_PLAN_STATE_ROOT` > `FLOWSTATE_SESSION_STATE_ROOT` | `[sessions].root` | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/flowstate/sessions/v1` or `~/.local/state/flowstate/sessions/v1` |
| Session hook root | `--state-root` > `FLOWSTATE_SESSION_STATE_ROOT` | `[sessions].root` | same as sessions root |
| Plan state root | `--state-root` > `FLOWSTATE_PLAN_STATE_ROOT` > `FLOWSTATE_SESSION_STATE_ROOT` | `[sessions].root` | same as sessions root (`<root>/plans/...`) |
| Flow state root | `--state-root` > `FLOWSTATE_FLOW_STATE_ROOT` > `FLOWSTATE_PLAN_STATE_ROOT` > `FLOWSTATE_SESSION_STATE_ROOT` | `[sessions].root` | same as sessions root (`<root>/flows/...`) |
| Bootstrap hook timeout | none | `[bootstrap].timeout_seconds` or hook override | `120` seconds |

`[scan].root` and `[sessions].root` support `~` and `~/...` expansion.
Session roots must resolve to absolute paths so captured transcripts stay out of
repositories. The scan root is cleaned before repository discovery; explicit
relative roots, including `WORKTREE_ROOT`, preserve relative repo paths for
compatibility. The same root is resolved from flowstate's current working directory
when used as the parent directory for left-pane repo creation.

## Example

```toml
[scan]
root = "~/dev"
max_depth = 2

[editor]
command = "code"

[terminal]
command = "wezterm start"

[provider]
name = "github"

[launch]
prefer_multiplexer = true

[ui]
default_view = 8

[agent]
command = "codex"
codex_reasoning_effort = "high"
claude_reasoning_effort = "max"
plan_prompt = "Implement the saved flowstate plan {title} (ID: {plan_id}) at {plan_path}. Read the plan file, then begin implementation."

[flow_prompts]
plan = "Produce a plan only for: {instructions}"
implementation = "Implement {plan_path} in {worktree_path}, then use the commit skill before completing."
review_loop = "Use review-loop for {branch}; use commit if revisions are made."
pr_creation = "Use ship for {branch}; record PR metadata for flow {flow_id}."
autoreview = "Autoreview {pr_url}; use ship when fixes require commits or pushes."

[sessions]
root = "~/.local/state/flowstate/sessions/v1"
copy_raw_transcripts = false

[bootstrap]
timeout_seconds = 120

[[bootstrap.hooks]]
repo_path = "~/dev/flowstate"
script = ".flowstate/bootstrap"

[[bootstrap.hooks]]
repo_path = "~/dev/client-api"
script = "~/bin/bootstrap-client-api"
timeout_seconds = 300
```

## Sections

### `[scan]`

Controls repository discovery.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `root` | string | Directory to scan for git repositories and parent directory for repos created from the left pane. |
| `max_depth` | integer | Scan depth below `root`; `1` scans immediate children, `2` also scans one level deeper. |

When `max_depth` is omitted or set to `0`, flowstate uses the scanner default of `2`.
Values greater than `2` behave like `2`.

Pressing `n` in the left repo pane creates a new local Git repository directly
under the resolved scan root. If the form's GitHub checkbox is enabled, flowstate
also runs `gh repo create <name> --public|--private --source <path> --remote origin`;
`gh` must be installed and authenticated. A GitHub failure after local creation
keeps the local repository and allows retrying only the GitHub/origin setup.
Repo names must be one path segment: they cannot be empty, `.`, `..`, start
with `-`, contain path separators, or end with `-worktrees` (reserved for flowstate
worktree directories).

### `[ui]`

Stores user-interface preferences.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `default_view` | integer | Optional startup view number. Valid values are `1` worktrees, `2` branches, `3` stashes, `4` history, `5` reflog, `6` sessions, `7` plans, `8` flows, and `9` active flows. Omitted keeps the built-in Flows startup default. |

Press `V` in flowstate to choose and persist this value from a picker. The picker
changes future launches only; use `1` through `9`, arrows, `h`, or `l` to switch
the current view.

### `[editor]`

Configures the editor used by the plans pane `e` action. The selected plan's
`plan.md` path is appended to the command, and the plans pane refreshes after
the configured command exits. Use wait flags such as `code --wait` for GUI
editors that detach by default. When this setting is omitted, flowstate falls back
to `$EDITOR`.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `command` | string | Shell-style editor command, such as `code --wait`, `vim`, or `vim -c "set ft=markdown"`. |

### `[terminal]`

Configures the external terminal fallback used by the `t` action, detached
agent-launch scripts, and embedded-terminal detach handoff. Active tmux/Zellij
sessions still take precedence for normal `t` and agent launches, and
`TERMINAL` still overrides this setting. Embedded detach handoff is different:
after `ctrl+] d` detaches a tmux-backed embedded terminal, flowstate uses
`TERMINAL`, then `[terminal].command`, then the macOS Terminal AppleScript
fallback when available. It never uses the active tmux/Zellij client, installed
inactive tmux/Zellij commands, `$SHELL`, or the current TTY as the handoff
transport.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `command` | string | Terminal command or supported macOS GUI app alias. |

Examples:

```toml
[terminal]
command = "wezterm start"
```

```toml
[terminal]
command = "iTerm"
```

On macOS, supported GUI aliases are `Terminal`, `Terminal.app`, `iTerm`,
`iTerm.app`, `iTerm2`, and `iTerm2.app`. Terminal aliases use the built-in
Terminal transport. iTerm aliases use AppleScript so both plain worktree
terminals and detached agent scripts open in iTerm.

Other command values are treated as whitespace-separated CLI terminal commands
when the first field exists on `PATH`; configured arguments are preserved as
separate argv entries and agent launches or detach handoff append
`-e sh -c <script>`. Shell quoting is not interpreted in this setting. On macOS,
an unsupported GUI app name can open a plain worktree terminal with
`open -a <app> <path>`, but it cannot run detached agent scripts or detach
handoff. Use a supported GUI alias or a CLI terminal command for agent launches
and embedded detach handoff.

### `[provider]`

Parsed for future provider-specific features.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Future provider name, such as `github`. |

### `[launch]`

Parsed for future launch behavior.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `prefer_multiplexer` | boolean | Future launch preference for tmux/Zellij behavior. |

### `[agent]`

Stores the selected coding agent for interactive launches. Pressing `A` in flowstate
opens an agent picker for `codex`, `codex-app`, or `claude` and updates this
value immediately, creating the config file if needed.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `command` | string | Supported values: `codex`, `codex-app`, or `claude`. |
| `codex_reasoning_effort` | string | Optional Codex CLI reasoning effort for new launches. Supported values: `default`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`. Empty or `default` omits the Codex override and keeps provider defaults. |
| `claude_reasoning_effort` | string | Optional Claude Code reasoning effort for new launches. Supported values: `default`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. Empty or `default` omits the Claude override and keeps provider defaults. |
| `plan_prompt` | string | Optional template for the editable instructions opened by `i` in the plans pane. Supports `{title}`, `{plan_id}`, `{plan_path}`, `{repo_path}`, and `{worktree_path}`. When a saved-plan phase row is selected, it also supports `{phase_id}`, `{phase_title}`, and `{phase_status}`. Unknown placeholders remain literal. Blank or omitted uses the built-in prompt. |

Press `F2` in normal TUI views to open the prompt-template editor. The editor
can save a custom `[agent].plan_prompt`, reset it to the built-in default, or
preview the built-in prompt.

In the flows pane, `E` opens a provider-specific reasoning-effort picker for
the selected CLI agent and persists the corresponding key. New Codex CLI
launches use `--config model_reasoning_effort=<effort>`; new Claude Code
launches use `--effort <effort>`. Session resumes do not receive effort flags.
`codex-app` launches keep app-side/default reasoning because the current deep
link path cannot carry a verified effort setting.

### `[flow_prompts]`

Optional templates for Flow phase launch prompts. Blank or omitted keys use
the built-in prompt for that phase. Unknown placeholders remain literal. flowstate
appends `After completing this phase goal, mark this Flow phase done with flowstate.`
to both built-in prompts and configured templates unless the template already
ends with that exact standalone instruction.

The `F2` prompt-template editor also manages these Flow prompt keys. Saving a
blank template resets that key by removing the config override.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `plan` | string | Template for the initial Plan phase launch. |
| `plan_review` | string | Template for Plan Review. |
| `implementation` | string | Template for Implementation. |
| `review_loop` | string | Template for Review Loop. |
| `pr_creation` | string | Template for PR Creation. |
| `autoreview` | string | Template for Autoreview. |
| `merge` | string | Template for Merge. |
| `generic` | string | Template for non-standard Flow phase IDs. |

Supported Flow placeholders are `{flow_id}`, `{flow_title}`,
`{instructions}`, `{phase_id}`, `{phase_title}`, `{plan_id}`, `{plan_path}`,
`{plan_body}`, `{repo_path}`, `{worktree_path}`, `{branch}`, `{commit}`,
`{base_ref}`, `{pr_provider}`, `{pr_number}`, `{pr_url}`, `{pr_head}`,
`{pr_base}`, and `{pr_status}`. Standard Plan Review, Implementation, Review
Loop, PR Creation, Autoreview, and Merge launches do not pre-read the linked
plan body, so `{plan_body}` is empty for those built-in phase types unless a
future phase path explicitly supplies it.

### `[sessions]`

Controls portable agent-session storage. Session metadata and normalized
transcripts are stored outside repositories by default. Each provider session is
stored under a hashed session directory, with the raw provider session ID kept in
`meta.json`.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `root` | string | Optional absolute state root for session files. Supports `~` expansion. |
| `copy_raw_transcripts` | boolean | Whether hook ingestion also preserves provider-native transcript JSONL as `raw.jsonl`. Defaults to `false`. |

When `root` is omitted, flowstate uses `$XDG_STATE_HOME/flowstate/sessions/v1`, or
`~/.local/state/flowstate/sessions/v1` when `XDG_STATE_HOME` is unset.
Relative roots other than `~`/`~/...` fail config parsing.

`[sessions].root` doubles as the **agent-artifact root**: sessions, saved plans,
and Flow records are stored under `<root>/sessions/...`,
`<root>/plans/<plan-id>/`, and `<root>/flows/<flow-id>/`. There is no separate
plans or flows config in v1. **Moving or cleaning the sessions root therefore
also moves or removes saved plans and Flow records.**

## Saved Plans

Agents persist plans explicitly through the `flowstate plan` subcommands; plans are
not captured from provider hooks in v1. Each plan is stored as
`<artifact-root>/plans/<plan-id>/meta.json` plus `plan.md`, with the same
restrictive permissions (`0700` directories, `0600` files) and atomic writes as
sessions. They appear in the TUI plans pane (mode `7`).
Use `e` in the plans pane to edit the selected `plan.md` with `[editor].command`
or `$EDITOR`; missing editor commands are shown in the TUI status bar. The plans
pane refreshes when the configured editor command exits.

```bash
# Save or update (reuse --plan-id) a plan; Markdown comes from --file or stdin.
# Prints only the plan_id.
printf '%s' "$PLAN_MD" | flowstate plan save --title "Persist plans" [--plan-id ID] \
    [--summary TEXT] [--status STATUS] [--source SOURCE] [--provider PROVIDER] \
    [--session-id ID] [--launch-id ID] [--repo-path PATH] [--worktree-path PATH] \
    [--branch BRANCH] [--commit HASH] [--file PATH] [--state-root PATH]

flowstate plan phase set --plan-id ID --phase-id ID --title TITLE --status STATUS [--order N] [--state-root PATH]
flowstate plan list [--repo-path PATH] [--state-root PATH] --json   # --json required in v1
flowstate plan read --plan-id ID [--state-root PATH]                # prints Markdown only
```

Plan statuses: `draft`, `approved`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`,
`superseded`. Phase statuses: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`,
`skipped`. Phase IDs are normalized (trimmed and lowercased) before matching,
so re-running `phase set` with the same logical `--phase-id` -- including case
or whitespace variants -- updates that phase in place instead of adding a
duplicate row, and repairs records that already contain duplicates. `plan_id` must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,127}$`; when
omitted, flowstate generates `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-<title-slug>` with a `-2`, `-3`, …
suffix on collision.

`save` always replaces Markdown and title from the command (both required), and
updates `status`, `source`, `summary`, and repo/session metadata only when
supplied; otherwise it preserves the stored values, `created_at`, and recorded
phases. A body-only re-save keeps the existing status.

The plan state root is resolved as: `--state-root` > `FLOWSTATE_PLAN_STATE_ROOT` >
`FLOWSTATE_SESSION_STATE_ROOT` > `[sessions].root` > the user state default. The
`flowstate plan` commands may load config to resolve the root but never scan repos or
start the TUI. Omitted metadata is filled from `FLOWSTATE_AGENT` (provider),
`FLOWSTATE_LAUNCH_ID`, `FLOWSTATE_REPO_PATH`, `FLOWSTATE_WORKTREE_PATH`, `FLOWSTATE_BRANCH`, and
`FLOWSTATE_COMMIT`; for new plans, and for updates that provide a repo or worktree
location, flowstate also resolves best-effort repo, worktree, branch, and commit
metadata from git. `codex-app` launches do not inherit `FLOWSTATE_*` shell
environment variables because flowstate opens a macOS deep link; flowstate uses the repo
path as the deep-link project path and includes worktree, state-root, plan, and
flow values as prompt-only launch metadata. That metadata includes copyable
`flowstate plan list --json --state-root ...` and
`flowstate flow list --json --state-root ...` examples that show where to pass the
state root for subsequent plan and flow commands.

## Flows

Flow records are task-centric workflow records created by the TUI or explicitly
through `flowstate flow`. Each record is stored as
`<artifact-root>/flows/<flow-id>/meta.json`, with restrictive permissions
(`0700` directories, `0600` files) and atomic writes. They appear in the TUI
flows pane (mode `8`), which is the startup default unless `[ui].default_view`
is set. The pane shows linked plan
IDs when present; press `n` to create a new Flow. On a Flow row or expanded
phase row, `enter` expands or collapses read-only phase detail rows; `o` opens
the linked plan body from the selected Flow. Press `g` to launch the first
launchable phase for the selected Flow. Press `y` to copy the selected Flow
worktree path from either a Flow row or one of its expanded phase rows. Press
`m` to toggle per-Flow auto mode. New Flow records start with auto mode on, and
the toggle is persisted on each Flow. Flows created before this field existed
remain manual until auto mode is toggled on. When auto mode is on, completed
CLI phases running in an embedded Flow terminal advance only after the completed
phase's terminal exits normally and auto-closes; terminal exit also triggers a
Flow refresh so newly persisted completion state is discovered without waiting
for unrelated UI activity. Auto mode still skips non-completed outcomes and
stops before Merge; Merge still requires a manual launch.
The active flows pane (mode `9`) shows active Flows across all repos and hides
merged Flow records. Moving focus to the left repo pane temporarily filters the
visible active rows to the selected repo, and returning focus to the middle pane
restores the global list. It supports the same Flow actions, phase launches,
attached-session resumes, auto-mode toggles, and embedded Flow terminal
management as the flows pane.
Headless mode is on by default:
selected CLI `codex` and `claude` phase launches run in an embedded terminal
inside the flows pane. Press `h` to choose the CLI command mode: headless runs
`codex exec` or `claude --print`, while headless off runs interactive `codex` or
`claude` in the same embedded Flow terminal. Headless-off Flow launches prefill
the phase prompt without submitting it, then focus the Flow terminal in input
mode so you can review or edit it before pressing enter. Headless launches keep
focus on the Flow list. Creating a new Flow has its own default-on Headless
checkbox for the initial Plan launch; uncheck it for an interactive initial
Plan launch. That checkbox does not change the selected-phase `h` setting.
Press `E` to choose the configured CLI agent's reasoning effort for future
launches; the shortcut pane shows the current value. Manual phase
launches, auto-launched phases, and new Flow Plan launches all use the
configured agent and that agent's configured effort, and require a CLI agent:
`codex-app` cannot run Flow phases, so Flow `g` launches are rejected and
a New Flow with Plan Now is blocked while `codex-app` is selected.
`codex-app` remains URL/deep-link based for its standalone launches and session
resumes, launches externally, and uses
app-side/default reasoning. Press `r` to resume an attached
provider session from the selected phase row; CLI resumes open in runtime-only
embedded PTYs in the flows pane, while `codex-app` resumes navigate externally.
While a Flow terminal is open, `tab` switches focus between the Flow list and
terminal. Manually tabbing into Flow terminal focus starts in flowstate command mode:
`left`/`right` cycles Flow terminals, `1`-`9` switches by number, `d` detaches to
tmux when available, `x` closes, `q`/`esc` quits, unknown ordinary keys do not
pass through to the PTY, and `ctrl+]` sends a literal `ctrl+]`; `i` enters
terminal input mode. In input mode, keys pass through to the PTY (including
agent shortcuts like `ctrl+g`) and `ctrl+]` returns to command mode. Embedded
headless output is rendered as
readable terminal text rather than raw provider event JSON; `codex exec` streams
progress while it runs, whereas `claude --print` only prints its result once the
run completes. Expanded rows
group child implementation phases directly under Implementation. New launches
record a launch ID and Flow/plan environment metadata for the agent; CLI
phase-session resumes also record a fresh launch ID, while `codex-app` resumes
navigate to the existing app thread without additional launch tracking. With
destructive mode enabled (`D`), `d` deletes only the selected top-level Flow
record under the Flow artifact store; it leaves linked plans, sessions,
transcripts, worktrees, repositories, branches, and checked-out code intact.
Other phase and progression mutation remains CLI/agent-driven in v1.

```bash
# Create a flow. --repo-path must be absolute, instructions are required, and
# --json is required in v1.
flowstate flow create --title "Ship saved plans" \
    --instructions "Plan, implement, review, open a PR, and merge." \
    --repo-path "$REPO" [--worktree-path PATH] [--branch BRANCH] \
    [--base-ref REF] [--commit HASH] [--state-root PATH] --json

# You may also read instructions from a file.
flowstate flow create --title "Ship saved plans" \
    --instructions-file ./instructions.md --repo-path "$REPO" --json

flowstate flow list [--repo-path PATH] [--state-root PATH] --json
flowstate flow read --flow-id ID [--state-root PATH]
flowstate flow phase complete --flow-id ID --phase-id ID \
    [--outcome OUTCOME] [--summary TEXT] [--notes TEXT] [--state-root PATH]
flowstate flow phase block --flow-id ID --phase-id ID \
    [--outcome OUTCOME] [--summary TEXT] [--notes TEXT] [--state-root PATH]
flowstate flow phase needs-attention --flow-id ID --phase-id ID \
    [--outcome OUTCOME] [--summary TEXT] [--notes TEXT] [--state-root PATH]
flowstate flow phase restart --flow-id ID --phase-id ID \
    [--notes TEXT] [--state-root PATH]
flowstate flow phase set --flow-id ID --phase-id ID --status STATUS \
    [--outcome OUTCOME] [--summary TEXT] [--notes TEXT] [--state-root PATH]
flowstate flow phase add-child --flow-id ID --parent-phase-id implementation \
    --phase-id ID --title TITLE --order N [--state-root PATH]
flowstate flow plan set --flow-id ID --plan-id ID [--plan-path ABSOLUTE_PATH] [--state-root PATH]
flowstate flow pr set --flow-id ID --provider github --number N --url URL \
    --head HEAD_BRANCH --base BASE_BRANCH [--status STATUS] [--state-root PATH]
```

When a Flow is linked to a saved plan, transitioning a Flow phase to `completed`
also marks a matching saved-plan phase with the same normalized phase ID as
`completed`. Missing saved-plan phases are ignored. If that sync fails, flowstate
marks the Flow phase `needs_attention` and reports the persistence error.
Repeating `completed` for an already-completed Flow phase preserves that
completed state even if the linked-plan sync later fails.

Flow IDs use the same safe single-path-segment shape as plans:
`^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,127}$`. Generated IDs use
`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-<title-slug>` with a numeric suffix on collision. New flows
start with a default phase graph: plan, plan review, implementation, review
loop, PR creation, autoreview, and merge.

Flow statuses are derived from phase and merge state. Flow statuses include
`pending`, `in_progress`, `needs_attention`, `blocked`, `completed`, `merged`,
and `abandoned`. Phase statuses include `pending`, `ready`, `running`,
`needs_attention`, `completed`, `blocked`, and `skipped`. The canonical phase
transition table, derived-readiness gate rules, and the on-disk compatibility
story live in [flow-phases.md](flow-phases.md).

The flows pane distinguishes recoverable partial states from ordinary phase
states. It shows `recover-worktree` when a saved Flow has no branch/worktree
metadata, `await-session` when a running phase has a launch attempt but no
attached provider session yet, `session-mismatch` when a phase's attached
session launch ID does not match the phase launch IDs, `missing-session-id`
when an attached session lacks a provider session ID, and `missing-pr` on a
pending Autoreview phase when PR Creation completed without structured PR
metadata.

On a selected `await-session` phase row, `x` offers a confirmed reset back to
derived `ready` only when no running or starting embedded Flow terminal is
attached to that same Flow phase. The reset removes the orphan launch attempt;
agents still cannot set `ready` directly.

The Plan Review phase gates Implementation. Plan Review completion must use
`--outcome approved` or `--outcome approved_with_concerns`; the latter requires
`--notes`. Use `--status needs_attention --outcome changes_requested --notes
...` for requested plan revisions, or `--status blocked --outcome blocked
--notes ...` for missing inputs or external blockers. Implementation becomes
ready only after approved Plan Review outcomes, or after an explicit
skipped-with-notes Plan Review override.

For common phase outcomes, `flowstate flow phase complete`, `flowstate flow phase block`,
and `flowstate flow phase needs-attention` wrap the same validation and persistence
as `phase set`, then print JSON containing the updated phase, the next
actionable phase state, and allowed statuses for that next action. Notes
requirements are still enforced by the same store rules as `phase set`. Plan
Review wrappers fill the unambiguous outcomes when omitted: `complete` uses
`approved`, `block` uses `blocked`, and `needs-attention` uses
`changes_requested`. Autoreview wrappers fill `passed`, `blocked`, and
`needs_attention` for the matching common outcomes. Use
`flowstate flow phase restart` to rerun a blocked or needs-attention phase as
`running`; if `--notes` is omitted, flowstate records a standard rerun note. Use
`phase set` when a phase needs an explicit uncommon status or a
skipped-with-notes override.

Implementation can be split into ordered child phases with
`flowstate flow phase add-child`. Child phase IDs are stable and normalized (trimmed
and lowercased): re-running the command with the same logical id -- including
case or whitespace variants -- updates the same child instead of duplicating
it, and updates collapse duplicate rows left by older records. `flowstate flow phase
set` resolves phase ids the same way. Child phases currently belong
under `implementation`; they gate review loop and PR creation until completed or
skipped with notes. Flow phase launch prompts stay minimal: Plan Review and
Implementation point to the saved plan artifact, while Review Loop and PR
Creation include only the worktree, branch, and start commit metadata needed to
inspect the changes. Built-in prompts tell Plan to produce only a plan,
Plan Review to use the review-loop skill with max 6 loops, Implementation to
use the `commit` skill, Review Loop to use the review-loop workflow with goal
`review-and-revise` and `commit` when revisions are made, PR Creation to use
the `ship` skill, and Autoreview to use `ship` when fixes require commits or
pushes. All Flow phase launch prompts also end with:
`After completing this phase goal, mark this Flow phase done with flowstate.`
Autoreview launch prompts include the PR target metadata but leave detailed
completion, needs-attention, blocked, and restart mechanics to the high-level
Flow phase commands.
Override `[flow_prompts]` keys to customize those phase templates; flowstate still
appends the common phase-done instruction to custom templates.

The PR Creation phase should record structured PR metadata with
`flowstate flow pr set` after a pull request exists. The command currently supports
GitHub PRs and validates the provider, absolute http(s) URL, positive PR
number, required head/base branches, and that the head branch matches the Flow
branch. Autoreview stays pending when PR Creation is complete but this PR target
metadata is missing.

The flow state root is resolved as: `--state-root` >
`FLOWSTATE_FLOW_STATE_ROOT` > `FLOWSTATE_PLAN_STATE_ROOT` > `FLOWSTATE_SESSION_STATE_ROOT` >
`[sessions].root` > the user state default. In TUI startup,
`FLOWSTATE_FLOW_STATE_ROOT` has highest precedence for the shared artifact root; if
it is set, the TUI reads sessions, plans, and flows from that root.

The canonical provider-agnostic Flow phase skill lives at
`agent-skills/flowstate/`. Install or symlink it into the user-level skill
directory for supported agents such as Codex or Claude; for Codex, a typical
target is `~/.codex/skills/flowstate`. The `flowstate` skill activates when
`FLOWSTATE_FLOW_ID` and `FLOWSTATE_FLOW_PHASE_ID` are present, reads the active
flow with `flowstate flow read --flow-id "$FLOWSTATE_FLOW_ID"`, and documents the
implemented `flowstate flow` / `flowstate plan` commands for phase persistence
and saved-plan linkage.

### `[bootstrap]`

Configures optional per-repo scripts that run after flowstate successfully creates a
worktree with `n`, `P`, or `N`. Hooks are opt-in and are matched by configured
repo path. flowstate does not auto-discover scripts from scanned repositories.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `timeout_seconds` | integer | Default hook timeout. Omitted or `0` means `120`; negative values fail startup. |

Add one `[[bootstrap.hooks]]` entry per repo:

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `repo_path` | string | Required repo path to match. Supports `~` expansion. |
| `script` | string | Required script path. Relative paths resolve from the newly created worktree; `~` paths are expanded. |
| `timeout_seconds` | integer | Optional per-hook timeout override; negative values fail startup. |

Bootstrap scripts execute directly, not through a shell. The script file must
exist, be a regular file, and be executable. flowstate sets the script working
directory to the new worktree and appends these environment variables:
`FLOWSTATE_REPO_PATH`, `FLOWSTATE_WORKTREE_PATH`, `FLOWSTATE_WORKTREE_REF`, and
`FLOWSTATE_WORKTREE_CREATE_KIND`.

If a hook fails, flowstate keeps the created worktree and branch, refreshes the
worktree list, and shows the hook error in the status bar. For `N`, a hook
failure prevents automatic agent launch; the agent can still be launched
manually afterward.

## Agent Session Hooks

Agents launched from flowstate with `a`, `N`, Flow `g`, or session
resume `r` are wired automatically. flowstate passes Claude Code or Codex a
session-end hook that calls the current flowstate binary, and it appends the
environment metadata listed below so the hook can associate the session with
the selected repo and worktree.

flowstate can also ingest hook payloads from manual provider configuration:

```bash
flowstate session-hook --provider claude
flowstate session-hook --provider codex
```

For development and tests, pass an explicit state root:

```bash
flowstate session-hook --provider codex --state-root /tmp/flowstate-sessions-test
```

`session-hook` loads the normal flowstate config before ingesting the hook payload.
`--state-root` overrides `[sessions].root`, and `FLOWSTATE_SESSION_STATE_ROOT`
overrides the configured root when `--state-root` is omitted. The
`copy_raw_transcripts` setting controls whether provider-native transcript data
is copied to `raw.jsonl`; it is off by default, and normalized transcript events
are still written for the sessions view.

Codex may ask you to review and trust the injected hook with `/hooks` before it
runs it. After trust is recorded for the unchanged hook command, later
flowstate-launched Codex sessions can save normally.

Claude Code hook example:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "flowstate session-hook --provider claude"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Codex hook example:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "flowstate session-hook --provider codex"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When flowstate launches or resumes a CLI agent session, it appends `FLOWSTATE_*`
environment metadata, including `FLOWSTATE_AGENT`, `FLOWSTATE_LAUNCH_ID`,
`FLOWSTATE_REPO_PATH`, `FLOWSTATE_WORKTREE_PATH`, `FLOWSTATE_BRANCH`, `FLOWSTATE_COMMIT`,
`FLOWSTATE_SESSION_STATE_ROOT`, `FLOWSTATE_PLAN_STATE_ROOT`, `FLOWSTATE_FLOW_STATE_ROOT`, and
plan or flow IDs, paths, and phase fields when available.
`codex-app` launches are the exception: flowstate opens a macOS deep link, scrubs
inherited `FLOWSTATE_*` from `open`, and includes prompt-only launch metadata with
copyable `--state-root` command examples. New `codex-app` threads use the repo
path for Codex App project identity when available; the selected worktree path
is still included in the prompt metadata.

Session resume uses the stored provider session ID. Codex resumes with
`codex ... resume <session-id>` and Claude Code resumes with
`claude ... --resume <session-id>`, while preserving the same flowstate hook and
metadata environment wiring as fresh launches. In the full sessions view, those
CLI resumes run inside runtime-only embedded PTYs in the sessions pane. When
`tmux` is available at launch time, those embedded CLI terminals are backed by a
per-launch tmux session and `ctrl+] d` detaches flowstate's embedded client while the
agent continues in tmux. flowstate then opens a new external terminal running the
tmux reattach command, using the detach handoff order described in
`[terminal]`. Platforms without `$TERMINAL`, `[terminal].command`, or the macOS
Terminal AppleScript fallback report the handoff error after detach; the agent
continues in the detached tmux session. When `tmux` is unavailable, flowstate uses
the direct embedded PTY path and reports detach unavailable. Fresh Flow `g`
launches and Flow phase-session resumes run CLI agents inside runtime-only
embedded PTYs in the flows pane; Flow headless mode chooses
headless provider commands (`codex exec` / `claude --print`) versus interactive
provider commands (`codex` / `claude`) inside that embedded terminal. Flow
phase-session resumes also run inside runtime-only embedded PTYs in the flows
pane. Other non-Flow agent launches keep using their existing external terminal
transport, and `codex-app` standalone launches and resumes keep using deep-link
transport (`codex-app` cannot run Flow phases). `ctrl+] x` and quit cleanup terminate embedded terminals and kill
tmux sessions created by the current embedded launch; detached sessions are no
longer owned by flowstate and are not terminated when flowstate exits. The TUI refuses to
resume a stored session whose provider session ID is blank (it reports this in
the status line instead), and command construction trims resume session IDs and
rejects whitespace-only ones, so a resume command never carries a blank `--resume`
argument.

Hook payloads whose `session_id` is blank or whitespace-only are rejected at
ingest time: no session record is persisted and no Flow phase attachment is
made.

For Codex hook payloads with `hook_event_name = "Stop"`, flowstate records the
session as ended. Claude hook ingestion also records ended sessions, using the
payload end time when present and the current time as a fallback.

Transcripts can contain secrets, credentials, private prompts, and proprietary
code. Keep the sessions root in user-private storage and avoid committing
captured transcript files.
